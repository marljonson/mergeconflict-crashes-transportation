## Overview
This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of crashes in 2025 with specific information that capture the full lifecycle of a crash. This dataset matters because it allows us to make hypotheses about failing roadway infrastructure or even about human behavior. We picked this dataset because California is a car-centric state with infrastructure that heavily favors cars while marginalizing public transportation. As such, nearly everyone relies on driving to get anywhere, which creates congestion and increases the likelihood of accidents, often fatal. With this dataset, we can identify areas where roads need road design, better signage or could benefit from more transit routes to reduce traffic congestion.
